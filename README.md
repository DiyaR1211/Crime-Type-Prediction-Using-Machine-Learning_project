# Crime-Type-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning_project
This project analyzes crime trends in Indian cities using machine learning. It predicts crime probabilities for different crime types based on historical data (2000-2012) using a Random Forest model. The Streamlit-based dashboard allows users to explore crime distributions and predict the likelihood of crime types in specific locations.
